# Tic Tac Toe

This project consists of building a Ruby version of Tic Tac Toe game [Tic Tac Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) using **Ruby**.

## About the project

The goal was to use **classes** and **methods** to set up the basic elements of the game.

The specifications for this project can be found at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/oop).

## Installation

No instalation needed, just download/clone this repository [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/anapdh/TicTacToe-Ruby) on your computer.

## How to play

1. The interface of this game will be your computer's terminal. Search _terminal_ in your computer to open it.
2. In the terminal, use the command `cd` to go to the place where you have saved/cloned the Tic Tac Toe repository. For example: _Desktop/User/tic-tac-toe/_. 
You may use the comand `ls` to see the files and repositories exitent in your current location.
3. Now, use the comand `cd bin` again to enter the folder and execute `ruby main.rb` in the terminal to start the game.
4. Enjoy the game!

## Game rules

1. Type the name of Player1, which will be signed to the symbol 'X';
2. Type the name of Player2, which will be signed to the symbol 'O';
3. Now the first player ('X') can select any space to insert the value, follow your number keyboard to compare the available spaces:
>        7 | 8 | 9
>        -----------
>        4 | 5 | 6	--> The number in the virtual board will be represented by the number on your keyboard.
>        -----------
>        1 | 2 | 3
4. Remember not to insert any invalid number (above 9) or repeat the same number that is already taken by a symbol (no cheating!!);
5. The winner will be the first player/symbol to complete a sequence of a row, column, or diagonal.
